                The Rungrado 1st of May Stadium is 
                a multi-purpose stadium occupying an area of 20.7 hectares 
                (51 acres) on Rungra Island, Pyongyang, North Korea.<br> It opened
                on 1 May 1989, with its first major event being the 13th World 
                Festival of Youth and Students. It is the second largest stadium
                in the world by seating capacity. <br>The stadium can officially 
                hold up to a maximum of 114,000 spectators.[2]

                The stadium's scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and resembles a magnolia blossom. 
                It hosts events on a main pitch covering 22,500 m2 (242,000 sq ft).
                Its total floor space is over 207,000 m2 (2,230,000 sq ft) 
                across eight stories, and the lobes of its roof peak at more
                than 60 m (200 ft) above the ground.[citation needed] 
                The stadium was originally built with an official capacity
                of 150,000. After a 2014 remodel which included the 
                replacement of some bench seating with individual seats, 
                observers estimated a new capacity of approximately 114,000.
                [3][4] It was later confirmed in November 2022 that the 
                stadium is still expandable up to 150,000.[2]

                After the 1988 Summer Olympics had been awarded to Seoul, North Korea intensified its efforts to 
                present itself as the legitimate Korean state. As part of these efforts, it successfully bid to organize the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in Pyongyang in 1989. Massive construction projects were initiated in preparation for the festival, one of which was the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium. At the time of completion, it was the largest stadium ever built in Asia.[5][6]<br>

                While the stadium is used for sporting events, it is more frequently the site of massive performances and shows celebrating President Kim Il Sung and the North Korean nation. In June–July 2002, it was the site of the giant Arirang Festival gymnastic and artistic performance. The extravaganza involved over 100,000 participants—double the number of spectators,[7] and was open to foreigners. These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September. The event was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records in 2007 as the largest gymnastics display ever, with 100,090 participants.[8]<br>
                
                Collision in Korea, the largest professional wrestling pay-per-view event ever, was held at Rungrado Stadium on 28–29 April 1995. Attendance was 150,000 and 190,000, respectively, according to local authorities.[9]
                
                After a two-year renovation project, the stadium reopened in 2015. In July 2017, the Rungrado Stadium played host to six group stage matches as part of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification.[10]
                
                In the September 2018 inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea gave a speech with Chairman Kim Jong Un to 150,000 North Korean spectators. 
                The speech has themes of unification, peace, and cooperation.[11]
